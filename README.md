Flipper
=======

Flipper is a small library for flipping features on and off in .NET projects.

It was inspired by the rails gem rollout. https://github.com/jamesgolick/rollout

It is available via a nuget package https://www.nuget.org/packages/Flipper

    Install-Package Flipper

Examples
========

Create an actuator

    var actuator = new Flipper.Actuator(new RedisClient());

Define a new feature

    var feature = actuator.Get("feature");

Allowing a percentage of users

    //Allows 10% of users to use the feature
    actuator.ActivatePercentage(feature, 10); 

Creating a group

    actuator.DefineGroup("betaUsers", new List<string> () { "1", "2", "15" });

Assign a group to a feature

    actuator.ActivateGroup(feature, "betaUsers");

Assign a user to a feature

    actuator.ActivateUser(feature, "1");

Check if a feature is active

    //True only if the percentage is 100
    actuator.IsActive(feature); 

    //Indicates if the user is in the percentage, users, or a group
    actuator.IsActive(feature, "1");
